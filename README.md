## Visit the [site](https://city-name-autocomplete-2019.herokuapp.com/) for full documentation
### Visit the [my swagger](https://city-name-autocomplete-2019.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html) for API endpoint documentation
### Story
This web application is built on Spring boot using Java 8 and Gradle. One of reasons for choosing Spring boot and Java 8 is the fact that I wanted to build something from scratch using this technology and to go through the challenges of the basic setup of the application, testing, and deployment configuration. The application uses Swagger UI to provide developers an easy access to the REST controllers supported by this application. You can access the swagger ui from API docs .

Further more, the app has been containerized and published on [docker hub repository](https://cloud.docker.com/u/feken/repository/docker/feken/dockerized-city-autocomplete), and also deployed on a remote [Heroku machine](https://city-name-autocomplete-2019.herokuapp.com/), It should be running now

```
// Build the app
gradlew build

// Run the app
java -jar build/libs/city-autocomplete-1.0.0.jar
// The app should start on port http://localhost:3112
